          <h2>WHAT'S SEASONAL EATING?</h2>
          <p>
          Seasonal eating is simple - it's the idea of eating fresh produce when it is naturally harvested. This doesn't mean you're going to starve during the winter, but it does mean you won't be eating raspberries year-round. To eat seasonally is to eat food produced locally, when it is fresh out of the fields.

        <h2>BUT WHY?</h2>
          <p>
          Our food system is currently global - food produced thousands of miles away often finds its way to our plates in larger quantities than food produced locally - is that an efficient allocation of resources? Eating locally has many positive implications. Here are three of the main ones: 

          <h3>taste and nutrition</h3>
          <p>Plants are living beings. As soon as you pick a pepper or clip a leaf of spinach, it begins to die. As plants die, the nutritional content (that's why we eat things other than bread and cheese, right?) starts to decrease. The closer the spinach grows to your plate, the less time it has to spend in transit - limiting the time the nutrient load has to decrease. When food has to spend such a long amount of time travelling, it can become over-ripe on the way. To counter this, farmers pick vegetables before they are ripe, which also substantially impacts the nutritional content and most importantly, taste of your food.
           </p>

          <h3>the environment</h3>
          <p>Food has to be grown somewhere. 
          Fresh food often has to be transported long distances, as quickly as possible. This means it is often carried by air - the most CO2-intensive means of transport. Eating food from nearby saves thousands of 'food miles'. A common definition of local food is food grown less than 250 miles away - a four hour drive doesn't seem particularly local, but isn't too bad, considering the average produce travels about 1500 miles from field to plate.</p>

          <h3>local economy</h3>
          <p>When your food comes from nearby, a larger percentage of every dollar you spend on food goes to the person who grew it, rather than a collection of shippers and transporters who handled it along the way. In a local food economy, farmers are more fairly compensated for their labour.
